# scheduleMaster-v1.0

A Grade 10 Project. I reattempted my Grade 9 JavaScript project on Java.

In essence, my Grade 9 project was a LOT better. Here, it is:: https://github.com/pranay-venkatesh/scheduleMaster because it implemented a full school system and not just the time table software. It also utilised event management.
